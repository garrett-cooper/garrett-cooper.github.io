I am a Graduate Researcher studying the epigenetic deregulation of rare pediatric cancers. Originally from Atlanta, I went on to earn a B.S. in Genetics from the University of Georgia where I gained appreciation for a proper bagel and college football.

After graduation, I moved *back* to Atlanta, where I began my PhD training in Genetics and Molecular Biology. I am particularly fascinated by chromatin remodelling complexes and how they are deregulated in a subset of cancers known as SMARCB1-deficient cancers. My current project is focused on elucidating the mechanisms by which these complexes are targeted to specific regions in the genome.

From a young age, I have always been a social person. For the past two years, I have brought that energy to Emory's campus as an executive member of the student group, **Graduate Students in Genetics**, which organizes various social functions throughout the year in addition to organizing fun outreach events for nearby high school students.

In the future I hope to bridge the gap between computational biology and molecular genetics to be a pioneer in the field of personalized medicine.
