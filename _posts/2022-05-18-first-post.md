Some big changes are happening in my life right now. I just finished taking classes after nearly **18 years** of continuous education. Also, I PASSED my qualifying exams, so now I'm officially a PhD candidate. These past couple months (and two years really) have been a complete whirlwind of grant writing, experiments, and stress that I haven't had time to really pause and think. So with my new found freedom and time, I decided to make this blog dedicated to highlighting my journey as a PhD Candidate (but also as a young adult living in Atlanta).

For the first time in a long time I feel at ease. I have a great apartment surrounded by friends and family. I'm lucky enough to enjoy living with my girlfriend, Brie, and my stinky dog, Gus. As a freshly minted PhD Candidate, I have a great summer ahead where I get to fulfill my dream of **FINALLY** becoming a full-time researcher. As I begin this journey as a candidate I am filled with both excitement and anxiety. Questions swirl in my head: "Am I good enough to actually do this?", "Will my experiments fail","Is my proposal actually just nothing?","What does the future have in store for me?" I know I'm not unique in the slightest for feeling this way. Thousands before me have felt will feel the same exact way I do. 

While these feelings are common across generations, I do not think this should minimize the enormity and seriousness of these feelings. I think often we dismiss our own struggles because many before us have dealt with the same thing. People who have "made it" look back fondly on earlier times and trivialize the struggles of a trainee. It's only been ~4 days since passing my quals and I already see myself doing this. What now seems like a foregone conclusion... that of course I would pass... did not at all seem like that just a few days earlier. I was stressed, scared, and had no idea what would happen. I'm sure in a year when the next crop of PhD students have their turn, I will declare with overconfident certainty that "Of course you will pass you'll be fine". Yet for those coming through, they stand before an abyss of scary unknown. 

I want to preserve this feeling of understanding I have now as I move forward in this life. The struggles of everyone, both older and younger, are very serious to them no matter how trivial they may seem to me at the time. The fear of giving that big talk, the fear of moving, or the fear of a job interview may seem small to those who have already done those things. Yet to those who have not had those experiences, are dealing with it for the first time. So I guess I'll leave it at this... as I go into the future I will try to be more open and understanding of peoples struggles and worries, no matter how small or insignificant they appear.

Until next time,

Garrett
